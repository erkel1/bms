# Battery Management System (BMS) Script Documentation
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# **Script Name:** bms.py
# **Version:** 1.10 (As of September 07, 2025) - Added thread safety with locks for web_data to prevent race conditions. Enhanced error handling in API routes with try/except and JSON error responses.
# **Author:** [Your Name or Original Developer] - Built for Raspberry Pi-based battery monitoring and balancing.
# **Purpose:** This script acts as a complete Battery Management System (BMS) for a configurable NsXp battery configuration (N series banks, X parallel cells per bank, where X = sensors_per_bank * number_of_parallel_batteries). It monitors temperatures from multiple Modbus slaves and voltages, balances charge between banks, detects issues, logs events, sends alerts, and provides user interfaces via terminal (TUI) and web dashboard. Includes time-series logging using RRDTool, ASCII line charts in TUI, and interactive charts in web via Chart.js.
#
# **Detailed Overview:**
# - **Temperature Monitoring:** Connects to NTC thermistors via Lantronix EDS4100 using Modbus TCP in multidrop RS485 configuration. Supports multiple slaves (one per parallel battery), each with num_series_banks * sensors_per_bank channels. Aggregates readings into global channels, groups by series bank for analysis. Applies calibration offsets, checks anomalies (high/low, deviations, rises, lags, disconnections). Handles per-slave errors gracefully.
# - Calibration: On first valid read (all sensors > valid_min across all slaves), computes overall median and offsets. Saves to 'offsets.txt' for future runs.
# - Anomalies Checked:
# - Invalid/Disconnected: Reading <= valid_min (e.g., 0.0°C).
# - High: > high_threshold (e.g., 42.0°C).
# - Low: < low_threshold (e.g., 0.0°C).
# - Deviation: Absolute > abs_deviation_threshold (e.g., 2.0°C) or relative > deviation_threshold (e.g., 10%) from bank median.
# - Abnormal Rise: Increase > rise_threshold (e.g., 2.0°C) since last poll.
# - Group Lag: Change differs from bank median change by > disconnection_lag_threshold (e.g., 0.5°C).
# - Sudden Disconnection: Was valid, now invalid.
# - **Voltage Monitoring & Balancing:** Uses ADS1115 ADC over I2C to measure voltages of num_series_banks banks. Balances if difference > VoltageDifferenceToBalance (e.g., 0.1V) by connecting high to low bank via relays and DC-DC converter (relay logic configurable via INI).
# - Heating Mode: If any temperature < 10°C, balances regardless of voltage difference to generate heat.
# - Safety: Skips balancing if alerts active (e.g., anomalies) or if balancer_failed flag is set. Rests for BalanceRestPeriodSeconds (e.g., 60s) after balancing.
# - Balancing Verification: During startup and regular balancing, monitors voltage trends. If no expected decrease in source or increase in destination (min_delta, e.g., 0.01V), raises alert and sets balancer_failed=True to prevent future balancing until restart or manual reset.
# - Voltage Checks: Alerts if < LowVoltageThresholdPerBattery (e.g., 18.5V), > HighVoltageThresholdPerBattery (e.g., 21.0V), or zero.
# - **Alerts & Notifications:** Logs to 'battery_monitor.log'. Activates alarm relay on issues. Sends throttled emails (e.g., every 3600s) via SMTP.
# - **Watchdog:** If enabled, pets hardware watchdog via dedicated thread (every 5s with aliveness check via timestamp) to prevent resets on hangs. Uses /dev/watchdog with 15s timeout (Pi max).
# - **User Interfaces:**
# - **TUI (Terminal UI):** Uses curses for real-time display: ASCII art batteries (dynamic for num_series_banks) with voltages/temps, alerts, balancing progress bar/animation, last 20 events. Now includes ASCII line charts for voltage history per bank and median temperature, placed in the top-right section for visualization of trends over time.
# - **Web Dashboard:** HTTP server on port 8080 (configurable). Shows voltages, temps, alerts, balancing status. Supports API for status/balance/history. Optional auth/CORS. Now includes interactive time-series charts using Chart.js for voltages per bank and median temperature, placed at the top of the page after the header for easy viewing.
# - **Time-Series Logging:** Uses RRDTool for persistent storage of bank voltages and overall median temperature. Data is updated every poll interval (e.g., 10s), but RRD is configured with 1min steps for aggregation. History is limited to ~480 entries (e.g., 8 hours). Fetch functions retrieve data for TUI and web rendering.
# - **Startup Self-Test:** Validates config, hardware connections (I2C/Modbus per slave), initial reads, balancer (tests all pairs for voltage changes).
# - Retries on failure after 2min. After max retries, proceeds to main loop with startup_failed reset to False to allow balancing, avoiding perpetual blocking. Logs warnings.
# - **Error Handling:** Retries reads (exponential backoff), handles missing hardware (test mode), logs tracebacks, graceful shutdown on Ctrl+C. Per-slave Modbus errors handled with alerts and fallback values.
# - **Configuration:** From 'battery_monitor.ini'. Defaults if missing keys. See INI documentation below.
# - **Logging:** Configurable level (e.g., INFO). Timestamps events.
# - **Shutdown:** Cleans GPIO, web server, watchdog on exit.
# **Key Features Explained for Non-Programmers:**
# - Imagine this script as a vigilant guardian for your battery pack. It constantly checks the "health" (temperature and voltage) of each part of the battery.
# - Temperatures: Like checking body temperature with 96 thermometers (for 4 batteries). If one is too hot/cold or acting weird, it raises an alarm.
# - Voltages: Measures "energy level" in each bank. If one has more energy than another, it transfers some to balance them, like pouring water between buckets.
# - Heating: In cold weather (<10°C), it deliberately transfers energy to create warmth inside the battery cabinet.
# - Alerts: If something's wrong, it logs it, turns on a buzzer/light (alarm relay), and emails you (but not too often to avoid spam).
# - Interfaces: Terminal shows a fancy text-based dashboard with ASCII charts for trends and lists all temps; web page lets you view from browser with interactive charts and full temp lists.
# - Startup Check: Like a self-diagnostic when your car starts – ensures everything's connected and working before running. Proceeds after retries with flags reset for operation.
# - Time-Series: Tracks history of voltages and temps, shows trends in charts to spot patterns over time.
# - Balancing Fail-Safe: Verifies energy transfer by checking voltage changes; disables balancing if hardware issue detected (e.g., relays not switching).
# **How It Works (Step-by-Step for Non-Programmers):**
# 1. **Start:** Loads settings from INI file (like a recipe book).
# 2. **Setup:** Connects to hardware (sensors, relays) – if missing, runs in "pretend" mode. Creates/loads RRD database for history.
# 3. **Self-Test:** Checks if config makes sense, hardware responds (per Modbus slave), sensors give good readings, aggregated. Balancing actually changes voltages (verifies relay switching via voltage deltas). If fail, alerts and retries. After max retries, proceeds with flags reset.
# 4. **Main Loop (Repeats Forever):**
# - Read temperatures from all slaves, aggregate.
# - Calibrate them (adjust based on startup values for accuracy).
# - Check for temperature problems (too hot, too cold, etc.).
# - Read voltages from configured banks.
# - Check for voltage problems (too high, too low, zero).
# - Update RRD database with voltages and median temp.
# - If cold (<10°C anywhere), balance to heat up (with verification).
# - Else, if voltages differ too much, balance normally (with verification).
# - Skip if alerts active or balancer failed.
# - Fetch history from RRD for charts.
# - Update terminal (with ASCII charts and full temp lists)/web displays (with Chart.js and full lists).
# - Log events, send emails if issues.
# - Update alive timestamp for watchdog.
# - Wait a bit (e.g., 10s), repeat.
# 5. **Balancing Process:** Connects high to low bank with relays, turns on converter to transfer charge, monitors voltages for changes, shows progress, turns off after time. Verifies deltas; alerts/disables if failed.
# 6. **Shutdown:** If you press Ctrl+C, cleans up connections safely.

# **Dependencies (What the Script Needs to Run):**
# - **Python Version:** 3.11 or higher (core language for running the code).
# - **Hardware Libraries:** smbus (for I2C communication with sensors/relays), RPi.GPIO (for controlling Raspberry Pi pins). Install: sudo apt install python3-smbus python3-rpi.gpio.
# - **External Library:** art (for ASCII art in TUI). Install: pip install art.
# - **Time-Series Storage:** rrdtool (for RRD database). Install: sudo apt install rrdtool.
# - **Standard Python Libraries:** socket (networking), statistics (math like medians), time (timing/delays), configparser (read INI), logging (save logs), signal (handle shutdown), gc (memory cleanup), os (files), sys (exit), argparse (command-line), threading (web server and watchdog), json/http.server/urllib/base64 (web), traceback (errors), fcntl/struct (watchdog), subprocess (for rrdtool commands), xml.etree.ElementTree (for parsing RRD XML output).
# - **Hardware Requirements:** Raspberry Pi (any model, detects for watchdog), ADS1115 ADC (voltage), TCA9548A multiplexer (I2C channels), Relays (balancing), Lantronix EDS4100 (Modbus for temps), GPIO pins (e.g., 5 for DC-DC, 6 for alarm, 4 for fan).
# - **No Internet for Installs:** All libraries must be pre-installed; script can't download. For web charts, Chart.js is loaded via CDN (requires internet for dashboard users).
# **Installation Guide (Step-by-Step for Non-Programmers):**
# 1. **Install Python:** On Raspberry Pi, run in terminal: sudo apt update; sudo apt install python3.
# 2. **Install Hardware Libraries:** sudo apt install python3-smbus python3-rpi.gpio.
# 3. **Install Art Library:** pip install art (or sudo pip install art if needed).
# 4. **Install RRDTool for Time-Series:** sudo apt install rrdtool.
# 5. **Enable I2C:** Run sudo raspi-config, go to Interface Options > I2C > Enable, then reboot.
# 6. **Create/Edit INI File:** Make 'battery_monitor.ini' in same folder as script. Copy template below and fill in values (e.g., emails, IPs, slave addresses).
# 7. **Run Script:** sudo python bms.py (needs root for hardware access).
# **Validate Config:** python bms.py --validate-config [--data-dir /path/to/config]
# 8. **View Web Dashboard:** Open browser to http://<your-pi-ip>:8080. Charts will load via Chart.js CDN.
# 9. **Logs:** Check 'battery_monitor.log' for details. Set LoggingLevel=DEBUG in INI for more info.
# 10. **RRD Database:** Created automatically as 'bms.rrd' on first run. No manual setup needed.
# **Notes & Troubleshooting:**
# - **Hardware Matching:** Ensure INI addresses/pins match your setup. Wrong IP/port/slave = no temps.
# - **Email Setup:** Use Gmail app password (not regular password) for SMTP_Password.
# - **TUI Size:** Terminal should be wide (>80 columns) and tall for full display, including all temps and charts.
# - **Test Mode:** If no hardware, script runs without crashing but warns.
# - **Security:** For web, enable auth_required=True and set strong username/password.
# - **Offsets File:** 'offsets.txt' stores calibration – delete to recalibrate.
# - **RRD Issues:** If rrdtool commands fail, check installation and permissions. Database 'bms.rrd' stores aggregated data; use rrdtool info bms.rrd for details.
# - **Common Errors:** I2C errors = check wiring/connections. Modbus errors = check Lantronix IP/port/slave addresses/RS485 wiring. RRD errors = ensure rrdtool installed and path correct.
# - **Performance:** Poll interval ~10s; balancing ~5s. Adjust in INI. Charts fetch from RRD (~480 entries) won't impact performance.
# - **Customization:** Edit thresholds in INI for your battery specs (e.g., Li-ion safe ranges). For longer history, adjust RRA in RRD creation.
# - **Watchdog Note:** Dedicated thread ensures reliable petting; resets only on true main hangs.
# - **Balancing Failures:** If voltage doesn't change during balancing, script detects it (no silent fail), alerts, and disables future balancing to prevent hardware damage.

    Balance the charge between two battery banks by transferring energy from high to low voltage.
    This function is like a water leveler for batteries. When one battery bank has more "energy level"

    from the fuller one to the emptier one, making their voltages more equal.
    It's like pouring water from a full bucket to an empty one to balance them out. The process
    takes time and shows progress on the screen. Safety checks prevent balancing if there are
    temperature problems or if it's too soon after the last balance.
    Now with verification: Monitors voltage changes to detect if balancing actually occurred (e.g., relays switched).
    If not, sets balancer_failed flag and alerts. For heating, balances regardless of diff to generate heat.
